One way to try to give a better name to a method.

If I go to the file where I intend to use the method that does not exist yet,
I can write a name that is more descriptive, because I can see it in action,
and I can think of the type of interface I need:

- Will I need the method to take arguments?
- Do I have a specific object I intend to reference already
available in this file/form?
- Is this method going to return a boolean and I can
name is with a `?`
