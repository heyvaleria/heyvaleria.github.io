# Motivation when learning a new language

I recently asked myself what new language or framework I should be studying,
revisiting, expanding my knowledge in, in order to grow and use it to work
on different types of projects.

I like some coding languages better than others, and when I was thinking of what
could convince me to dedicate time to improve on languages I don't enjoy as
much, I remembered the relationship between motivation and goal of learning
a foreign language, published by the two scholars Gardner and Lambert in 1972,
then in my Italian books also expanded by the scholar Balboni.

I would like to add links here, but they are so many I would not know where to
start and mostly stop.

We can observe 4 types of motivation:
- Intrinsic motivation, it comes from inside the learner, and it's linked to
  emotions and desires.

- Extrinsic motivation, linked to external factors, like school.

- Integrative intrinsic when the learner _wants_ or integrative extrinsic when the
  learner _must_ find integration in the other culture.

- Instrumental motivation when it can help with work and professional status.


Then Balboni (in "Le Sfide di Babele") analyses motivation under 3 categories:
1. the **obligation** to learn, like in school for example, that if it is not backed
   by interest in the learner, it becomes _apprendimento_ (roughly translated as
   "learning") but not _acquisizione_ (roughly translated as "acquisition").
   The information is stored in the short-term memory and quickly forgotten.
2. the **need** to learn, linked to the left-hand side of the brain (more about
   reasoning in super-short), where the learner need to develop specific knowledge
   to reach a goal.
3. the **enjoyment** to learn, linked to the right-hand side of the brain (super
   simplifying, the side dedicated to emotions), but can also involve the left-hand
   side, and therefore become more powerful.

In conclusion, I hope JavaScript can become a language I enjoy learning.
