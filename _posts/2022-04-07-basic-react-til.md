Thanks to [Diego](https://github.com/codeofdiego) for explaining and help me understand.
I know posting images with text is not accessible.

I apologize. I should make a better version later, with a code snippet and text comments.

There was a previous version of these screenshots that I lost forever, so these
other versions are slightly less taken care of and polished.

But still worth the TIL for my own sake.
