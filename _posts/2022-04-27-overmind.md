> [Overmind](https://github.com/DarthSim/overmind) is a process manager for
Procfile-based applications and tmux.
With Overmind, you can easily run several processes from your Procfile in a
single terminal.

So in the scenario where you have a Rails project with a `Profile` file that is
run by [foreman](https://github.com/ddollar/foreman) but you want to use a
`binding.pry` to debug some running code in the rails server, for example.
Putting the pry and seeing it in the foreman stack doesn't work well, it doesn't
stop or let you step through, so:

1. one simple option is to run all the script separately, in different tabs of
  the terminal.
2. use the gem `remote-pry` (but then you have to install another gem in your
  repo, meh if unnecessary)
3. install `overmind` using `brew`

Run your `Procfile` automatically with `overmind start`.
If you have more than one `Procfile` for some reason, specify which one
`overmind start -f Procfile.dev`.

Then in another tab, attach to the service you want, say for the rails server
is likely `web` (whatever is the key in the `Procfile`, usually, following
common patterns it will be `web`).
At that point you're gonna see the regular stack trace of the rails server.

If you kill it with control+C, it will kill the entire process, so check the manual
for various extra flags and commands.

Thanks to [Fer](https://github.com/FerPerales) for this TIL!
