When I started learning how to code at General Assembly, my teammates
and I were strongly encouraged to practice the so-called
[rubberducking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging).
They were telling us to get a toy and talk to it.
I remember finding it very unnatural and difficult to do.

Fast forward many years, I find myself doing this all the time,
when I reach out for help to my team, when I start typing a very long
message on Slack, to explain what I am trying to accomplish
and what I have already tried and failed.

In most cases, I interrupt in the middle of typing the message, because
it occurs to me yet another thing I could try.
In many cases, I delete the whole message before I even hit enter.
PROBLEM SOLVED.

In other cases, my logorrheic stream of consciousness, still makes
it to the posted state. Like commenting on my own Pull Requests on GitHub.
If anything, it shows my thought process, not that anyone asked. ðŸ˜…
