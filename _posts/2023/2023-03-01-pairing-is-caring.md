I work at [thoughtbot](https://thoughtbot.com/team) where a huge part of our culture is pairing every day.
There are many reasons to be pairing:
- to solve bugs,
- to act upon incidents,
- to help a teammate who is stuck on something,
- or vice versa, to get help,
- or to work on features.

The first ones on the list seem to be the most common scenarios when folks think about pairing, I guess, where I really enjoy developing something new as a pair.

I like pairing when I don't know the answer to something, either because it is broken or not working as intended, or because it has to be designed and the code has to be written yet.

We have some nice [guidelines](https://thoughtbot.com/blog/how-to-get-better-at-pair-programming) with a few suggestions on how to get the most out of a pairing session, but I also realize it takes time and exercise to produce a fulfilling pairing session.

Starting with a plan, both practical (length of the session, who drives etc) and what we want to accomplish by the end is crucial.

If I already know how to do something I technically don't need to pair, except, I can still write better code, or refactor it, or have a stronger Pull Request as a result regardless.

If I already know how to do something, I can still take the opportunity to pair with another developer who maybe has less experience and they can be exposed to something new, like a new language they don't use daily or a different part of the app we're working on.

Besides, it is also a great exercise in refining my mentoring skills. (And this does NOT mean lecturing!)
I want to be on both sides.

In my ideal pairing session, there should be many questions and less statements. We are figuring things out.

In my ideal pairing session, we don't give anything for granted, about anyone's knowledge, or about aspects of the code: sometimes the solution was in something we thought about but didn't consider out loud.

In my ideal pairing session, we explain things to each other, because we want to share our thought process, and because it helps clarify and solidify why we chose to do things in a certain way. Or we can ask the other about something they're doing and we are not familiar with.

In my ideal pairing session, we take nice breaks.
Which brings me, at last, to a little nostalgic note: up to the end of high school, or so, I recall that I used to study together with classmates a lot, mostly in pairs, doing our homework, taking little snack breaks at the local pizza shop, getting a slice and a piece of cecina.
I wish I remembered more about how we did those pairing sessions fueled by pen and paper, but I guess they still made me who I am today, and as long as it is a growth path, it's great.

Oh, one last thing: don't forget the `Co-authored-by` line at the end of your commit message! âœ¨
