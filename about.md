### -> me
I am Valeria, a developer at [thoughtbot](https://thoughtbot.com/).
I am from Pisa, Italy.
This blog started as a journal to keep track of the things I learn, and re-learn
and remember every day.

### -> this blog
Naming variables is one of the hardest things.

Naming pets, bikes and songs is easier.

Coming up with names for usernames, blogs and website domains is also hard.

When a friend was visiting Seattle and asked me for things to see and
attractions, I mentioned Viretta Park, the apparently historical park where the
legend says Kurt Cobain used to go hang out etc.

But I didn't want to get my friend's hope too high on what to expect, so
the text I sent him was like: "Then there is Viretta Park -- it's a bench".

In the same way, you should not expect too much from this blog, other than
coding and consulting experiences learned and seen through my perspective.
