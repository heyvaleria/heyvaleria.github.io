Naming variables is one of the hardest things.

Naming pets, bikes and songs is easier.

Coming up with names for usernames, blogs and website domains is also hard.

When a friend was visiting Seattle and asked me for things to see and
attractions, I mentioned Viretta Park, the apparently historical park where the
legend says Kurt Cobain used to go hang out etc.

But I didn't want to get my friend's hope too high on what to expect, so
the text I sent him was like: "Then there is Viretta Park -- it's a bench".

In the same way, you should not expect too much from this blog, other than
coding and consulting experiences learned and seen through my perspective.
